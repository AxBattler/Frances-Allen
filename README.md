### Frances Allen

  - She was a woman involved in computers at a time when computing was so new that few men even persued careers in computing.
  - She was born the same day as my grandmother, who also worked in technology.
  - For how influential, unusual, and impressive her life has been, it's remarkable that I hadn't heard anything about 
     Ms. Allen  before now.
